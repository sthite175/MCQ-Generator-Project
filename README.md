# MCQ Generation Using Generative AI
### Overview
MCQ Generation Using Generative AI is an innovative project that leverages the power of generative artificial intelligence models to automate the process of creating multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Traditional methods of crafting MCQs can be time-consuming, but with the integration of advanced language models, this project aims to streamline the question generation process for educators, content creators, and anyone involved in developing assessments.

### Key Features
### Automatic Question Generation: 
The system uses generative AI models to automatically generate MCQs based on input text, eliminating the need for manual question creation.

### Customization Options:
Users can customize the generated questions by specifying parameters such as the number of questions, subject matter, and difficulty level, ensuring tailored assessments.

### Evaluation and Review:
The generated questions are subject to an evaluation process to assess their complexity and appropriateness, providing users with valuable insights and the ability to refine the questions.

### Language Model Integration:
The project utilizes state-of-the-art language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5, to ensure the quality and coherence of the generated questions.
